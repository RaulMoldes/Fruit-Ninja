# Fruit Ninja
A simple implementation of Fruit Ninja Game using Unity 2022.3
## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the popular game Fruit Ninja using Unity 2022.3. The game involves slicing fruits that are thrown onto the screen by swiping your finger (or mouse in this case) across them.
## Features
- Fruit Slicing: The main feature of the game is slicing fruits. The fruits are randomly thrown onto the screen and the player has to slice them by swiping across them.
- Bombs: Occasionally, bombs are also thrown onto the screen. The player has to avoid slicing these as it results in a game over.
## How to Play
- Start the game: Click on the 'Play' button on the main menu to start the game.
- Slice fruits: Swipe your mouse across the fruits that appear on the screen to slice them.
- Avoid bombs: Be careful not to slice the bombs that appear on the screen.
- Score points: Try to slice as many fruits as you can to score points. Slicing multiple fruits in a single swipe will give you extra points!
